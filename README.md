# DA1301_assignment
## Introduction
My name is Siddharth Maira, roll number: DA25B047. I am interested in programming and math. My hobbies include reading books, coding, playing badminton and listening to music.

## What do I like most about git?
I like the commands `git commit` and `git restore` the most because they are extremely useful for version control on large projects.

## Which python assignment problem did I enjoy the most?
I liked the problem which required us to find the first non-repeating character in a string, because it required us to do time and space complexity analysis of our solutions, in comparison to all the other questions, which involved basic python programming.
